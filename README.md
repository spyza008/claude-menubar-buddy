# Claude Menu Bar Buddy




A hardware-free, native macOS menu bar companion for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) — a desk pet that reacts to permission requests (Allow/Deny), and shows session status, token usage, and plan limits at a glance.

It's a software-only stand-in for Anthropic's [Claude Desktop Buddy](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-desktop-buddy) (the M5StickC-based BLE hardware pet). No soldering, no BLE pairing, no separate device — just a 🐼 in your menu bar.

## What it looks like

<img width="336" height="432" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fe47a82-6fde-4d50-a02d-f74e664113a9" />

*(No pending requests · session status · tokens used today · 5-hour and weekly plan limits)*

When a permission request comes in, the icon changes, a sound plays, and the dropdown shows the tool + command with Allow/Deny buttons.

## Features

- **Approve/Deny in the menu bar** for Bash, Write, Edit, WebFetch, and NotebookEdit tool calls — an alternative to answering permission prompts in the terminal or Claude Desktop
- **17 pet characters** to choose from (`Choose Buddy` submenu): a pixel-art panda plus 16 ASCII-art pets reused from the M5Stick Hardware Buddy firmware (cat, turtle, dragon, ghost, robot, and more)
- **Session status** — idle / active, based on recent Claude Code session file activity
- **Active Sessions submenu** — lists each active session's project path and how long ago it was last active; click one to reveal that project folder in Finder
- **Mood pet** — the pet itself reacts to your 5-hour limit: active below 50%, visibly tired at 50%, sleepy-eyed at 80%, and fast asleep (with drifting Zzz) once the limit is hit — same joke for all 18 pets
- **Pet the buddy** — click the pet in the dropdown for a happy heart-eyes reaction
- **Celebrate on refresh** — when the 5-hour limit rolls back over to healthy, the pet throws a little arms-up celebration (with a notification) instead of silently snapping back to idle
- **Token usage today** — summed from local session transcripts, no network calls
- **Plan usage** — 5-hour and weekly limit bars, read from the same file Claude Desktop itself writes, color-coded (green/orange/red at 50%/80% used)
- **Threshold notifications** — a macOS notification fires the first time a limit crosses into the warning (50%) or critical (80%) band, so you don't have to keep the menu open to notice
- **Login item** — starts automatically, no manual launch needed
- Everything updates fresh each time you open the menu (no background polling wasting CPU)

## How it works

A `PreToolUse` hook (`hook.sh`) is registered in `~/.claude/settings.json`. When Claude Code is about to run a tool that needs a permission decision, the hook:

1. Writes the request (tool name + command/file/URL) to `~/.config/claude-menubar-buddy/pending_request.json`
2. Polls for a response file for up to 60 seconds
3. If you click Allow/Deny in the menu bar app, it writes `response_<id>.json`, which the hook picks up and returns as the tool decision
4. If nothing responds in time, the hook returns nothing and Claude Code falls back to its normal interactive prompt — so this is additive, never a single point of failure

No BLE, no external device, no cloud service — just local files.

## Install

See [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md) — it's written as a self-install skill for Claude Code itself. Clone this repo, open it in Claude Code, and ask Claude to read `SKILL.md` and install it. Claude will:

- generate the pet GIFs (if not already committed),
- build the app with `swift build` (no Xcode required, just Command Line Tools),
- install the hook script and merge the `PreToolUse` config into your own `~/.claude/settings.json` (never overwriting existing settings),
- register a login item,
- and launch it.

You'll be asked to approve one native permission prompt along the way (editing `settings.json` itself is intentionally never auto-approved by a hook — that would be a way for a hook to grant itself more power unsupervised).

### Manual install

If you'd rather do it by hand:

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd claude-menubar-buddy
python3 generate_gifs.py            # panda
python3 generate_species_gifs.py    # other 16 pets (needs claude-desktop-buddy checked out too — see script header)
swift build
mkdir -p ~/.config/claude-menubar-buddy
cp hook.sh ~/.config/claude-menubar-buddy/hook.sh
chmod +x ~/.config/claude-menubar-buddy/hook.sh
```

Then merge the `hooks.PreToolUse` block from `SKILL.md` into `~/.claude/settings.json` yourself (use your actual home directory in the `command` path, not `~`), and optionally set up the LaunchAgent plist shown there for auto-start at login.

## Requirements

- macOS 13+
- Swift 5.9+ (Xcode Command Line Tools — `xcode-select --install`)
- Python 3 with Pillow (`pip3 install Pillow`) — only needed to (re)generate GIFs
- `jq` (`brew install jq`) — used by the hook script

## Project layout

```
Package.swift                          # Swift Package manifest
Sources/ClaudeMenuBarBuddy/
  main.swift                           # menu bar UI, hook polling, species picker
  UsageStats.swift                     # reads session JSONL + plan-usage-history.json
  Resources/                           # generated GIFs + species.txt (checked in)
hook.sh                                # the PreToolUse hook script
generate_gifs.py                       # renders the pixel-art panda GIFs
generate_species_gifs.py               # extracts ASCII pets from claude-desktop-buddy and renders them
SKILL.md                               # self-install instructions for Claude Code
```

## Uninstall

```bash
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.claudemenubarbuddy.app   # or your LaunchAgent label
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claudemenubarbuddy.app.plist
rm -rf ~/.config/claude-menubar-buddy
```

Then remove the `hooks.PreToolUse` entries pointing at `claude-menubar-buddy/hook.sh` from `~/.claude/settings.json`.

## Why this exists instead of the hardware Buddy

Both are complementary, not competing — see the [Claude Desktop Buddy](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-desktop-buddy) project if you want the physical version too. This one exists because:

- No hardware to buy or wait for shipping on
- No BLE pairing, no Developer Mode toggle in Claude Desktop required
- Covers Claude Code's own permission hooks directly, which the BLE bridge doesn't see
- Compiles fresh from source on your machine, so there's nothing to code-sign or notarize, and no Gatekeeper friction

If a hardware Buddy is also paired, they don't conflict: this app's hook resolves the decision first (before a native prompt is even shown); if it times out, the request falls through to the normal prompt, which the hardware Buddy can also see and approve from.
